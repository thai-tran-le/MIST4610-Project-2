## Problem Description
Our data set is related to the car accidents in Cincinnati from 2013 to 2020 and we were able to obtain this data on kaggle. The fields of the data set describe the time and date of the crash, type of accident, gender, injuries, conditions of the road, and context of the situation, along with other attributes. With the dimensions available we can analyze the correlation between many different dimensions and their correlation to crash statistics. 




## Models and Questions

How many car accidents were reported in Cincinnati from 2013 to 2020 for each gender and age?


The data set assisted us in visualizing the answer by creating a bar chart and line graph. In the bar chart, we separated gender into two different charts with the same scale making them easy to compare. Each bar represents a different age group. In the line chart, we broke down the genders and added in a prediction of accidents in the future. The answer to this question could help an insurance company in Cincinnati decide on the cost of a plan for a young male or an older female driver.

How many crashes occur by zip code in Cincinnati?


The second question answered using the data set was how many crashes occur by zip code in Cincinnati. We used the generated longitude and latitude to create a mapping of the Cincinnati area, along with providing the detail of the count of crashes. In doing this we were able to create a heat map of the crashes by zip code. This game is a great visualization of the density of crashes in Cincinnati. Looking at the map, we can see the higher density areas of Cincinnati due to the amount of crashes (The darker areas are the more populated parts of the city). From the bar graph we can see that 45202 is the zipcode with the highest number of crashes. Doing further research our team has discovered that 45202 zip code is the downtown part of Cincinnati which makes sense when looking at the heat map of the number of crashes. 




## Manipulations
Our group decided to exclude the year 2021 from our data set since it seemed to be an outlier that lacked a full year of data. In our line graph from question 1, it made the line decrease dramatically leading to inaccurate results about our set of data. In the same line graph, we also included a future prediction of accidents to get an accurate prediction of the number of car crashes in the following year.




## Analysis and Results
In our first question, we wanted to create visualizations to show the correlation and hopefully story behind the data. Our first question was talking about the relationship between the number of crashes and the gender of the driver. With the top-line graph in our dashboard, we could see the number of crashes by gender over a period of years. From this graph, we can see that men have a higher number of crashes and there seemed to be a peak in the graph around 2016 and 2017. In our second graph, we have a bar chart that shows the number of crashes by gender by age. This shows a unique view on the question because it brings the ages of the drivers into question as well. We can see from this graph that female drivers under the age of 25 have higher numbers of crashes compared to men. While men ages 31-40 have much more serious accidents than females in the same age category.






After visualizing our data, there is a clear correlation between where in the city you are and the number of crashes that occur. What we have concluded is that the closer you are to the downtown area of Cincinnati, the more likely there are to be car crashes there. The downtown portion of Cincinnati, located in zip code 45202, is where more car crashes occur than anywhere else in the city. Home to many tourist attractions like Paycor Stadium, home of the Cincinnati Bengals, it makes sense for a majority of crashes to take place here rather than in a less densely populated area. Furthermore, zip codes surrounding downtown, like 45214, also tend to have a higher number of accidents than locations farther from downtown Cincinnati.
